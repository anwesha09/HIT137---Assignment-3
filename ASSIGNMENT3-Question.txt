You will develop a desktop application that demonstrates your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles, GUI development using Tkinter, and image processing using OpenCV.

Functional Requirements
1. Object-Oriented Programming
Your application must be structured using at least three classes, and demonstrate the following OOP concepts: Encapsulation, Constructor, Methods, Class Interaction.

2. Image Processing with OpenCV
Implement the following image processing features using the OpenCV:
• Grayscale Conversion – Convert image to black and white
• Blur Effect – Apply Gaussian blur with adjustable intensity
• Edge Detection – Use Canny edge detection algorithm
• Brightness Adjustment – Allow users to increase/decrease brightness
• Contrast Adjustment – Allow users to adjust image contrast
• Image Rotation – Rotate image by 90°, 180°, or 270°
• Image Flip – Flip image horizontally or vertically
• Resize/Scale – Allow users to resize the image

3. Tkinter GUI
You have the flexibility to design any user interface, provided it effectively supports all required functionality.

Required GUI Elements:
• Main Window – A properly sized window with an appropriate title
• Menu Bar – Include File menu (Open, Save, Save As, Exit) and Edit menu (Undo,Redo)
• Image Display Area – A canvas or label to display the current image
• Control Panel – Buttons or a sidebar for filter/effect options
• Status Bar – Display current image information (filename, dimensions, etc.)

Required Functionality:
• File dialogs for opening and saving images
• Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP)
• At least one slider for adjustable effects
• Message boxes for confirmations and errors
